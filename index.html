<h1>This isn't NPM!</h1>
<h2>This could have been a malicious site that steals your NPM credentials</h2>

<p>At first glance this URL looks benign.
<p>You might have even checked the URL before you clicked.
<p>But this is a fake link that takes advantage of the fact that m and rn look the same,
<p>and could have been used to steal your npm credentials.
<p>Be careful out there, and watch out for typos!
